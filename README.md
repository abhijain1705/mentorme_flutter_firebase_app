# Mentor Me
##💡 Inspiration
Whenever we start new thing in life, we always get confused on what to do, where to start, how to do, whom to talk and so on. in this case if we have direct access to people who already had did this in their life, it would be better and thats why I built this platform.

## 💻 What it does
I have build a full stack social media application in flutter and firebase which highly focus on experience so if you have any sort of experience in your life, whether it is travelling to place, reading a book, getting a job, running a business, cracking a exam or etc. you can share it on app and other freshers can consume your content.

features----
-> create profile using google auth, edit and logout.
-> inbuilt chat application, chat with anyone one-o-one.
-> also shows user is online/offline.
-> make a new post, pic images from gallery.
-> navigation, onboarding screens and proper error handling.
-> focus on scalability of app with pagination rendering.
